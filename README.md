## Features

Highlights duplicate lines in the active open note. Hovering over a highlighted line will show a tooltip with the line number where it is duplicated.

Also, a notice is shown when pasting new lines that are already duplicates of existing lines in the file.

## Motivation

When using obsidian notes to keep track of items, such as web links. I often don't know if the item I'm about to add already exists, and end up duplicating the same item multiple times, this plugin helps prevent this.

## Installation

This plugin is not part of Obsidian community plugins yet, in the meantime you can download the [latest release]() and set it up manually by vopying it to [yourvault]/.obsidian/plugins and then enabling it in settings.
